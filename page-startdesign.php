                <p>With a custom WordPress site, your small business can go from “Meh,” to “Money!” as it attracts your ideal audience, blows up conversion rates, and skyrockets traffic. We take your simple seed or idea and breathe functionality, practicality and optimization through it so you can run forward with a truly inspired new site. Including full site installation, setup, and support, the investment of $2-5K is well worth it.</p>

You’ll work through my client questionnaire (10 questions, so nothing super long!) that digs into the nitty gritty of your business goals, ideal customer and aesthetic. You’ll also craft up a private Pinterest board of 25-35 images – logos, typography, outfits, textures, colour palettes, websites – that really speak to your vibe and aspired brand feel. We’ll walk through both one week before our project start date.</p>

This is your chance to click around the site as if it were live to test the functionality on different browsers, provide feedback, ask questions, and prep the site for installation. After the demo site has been finalized, the final payment is due before we schedule an installation time and date that works well for both of us. During that time, we’ll put up a simple customized landing page on your site so all your fans can still find you! When the install is complete, we’ll email you a personalized video walkthrough of your shiny new site with directions on how to use it and make changes.</p>
